Implementation of the MalJPEG paper published in IEEE Xplore by Avaid Cohen et al. in January 2020.

Language -> Python

We have implemented the main proposal of extracting the MalJPEG features from a JPEG and training them on Sciki-learn ML libraries.

The malicious images were obtained from virusshare.com, and the benign images from a random Kaggle dataset.
